This is my multiclass furniture classifier. Its three classes are bed, chair and sofa. Steps to running the classifier:

Partition the dataset images using the create_sets.py file. Run using the command line with the following command: python3 create_sets.py <Dataset-file> 0.5 0.25
The last two figures represent the proportion of training and validations sets are made. The test set is the proportion remaining. 

To get the best model run the furniture classifier jupyter notebook. Inside this file there are many different networks, each trying to improve accuracy while
reducing overfitting. Comment out all models except for the ResNet50 base model if you just want the most efficient model.

Run the app.py file through the command line with python app.py to open the API for the classifier.

Run the dockerfile to get the docker image of this flask application.
